      <h2>Understanding Consistency</h2>
      <p>
        In computer science, consistency refers to the property that ensures data is the same across all nodes in a distributed system. 
        Consistency is one of the critical aspects of the CAP theorem, which dictates that a system can only have two out of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
      </p>
      <h2>Scopes in Programming</h2>
      <p>
        Scopes define the context in which a variable or function is accessible. There are generally two types of scopes:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variables defined globally can be accessed anywhere in the program.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Scope:</strong> Variables defined within a function or block can only be accessed inside that specific context.</li>
        </ul>
        Understanding scope is crucial for memory management, debugging, and avoiding variable name conflicts in programming.
